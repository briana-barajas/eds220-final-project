# Phoenix Biodiversity Change Assessment 
_This repository contains an analysis of biodiversity change within the Phoenix, AZ Census Subdivision utilizing the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)_

## Background
Between 2001 and 2019, Maricopa County, located in the Phoenix metropolitan area of Arizona, added over 270 miles of developed land. This includes buildings, roads, and other structures that have the potential to disturb and negatively impact biodiversity in surrounding areas. Measures of biodiversity, such as the biodiversity intactness index (BII), are crucial for creating conservation and restoration plans. Global raster data on BII from 2017 to 2020 was produced and published by Impact Observatory. This analysis combines BII data from Impact Observity as U.S. Census shapefile data to analyze changes in BII between 2017 and 2020.

## Visualizations
Visualizations include a map of the Phoenix metropolitan area and a map of BII in 2020, highlighting areas where BII has fallen below 75% compared to 2017. All visualizations can be found within the `images` folder.

## Highlights
* Satellite imagery
* Biodiversity
* Raster import and analysis using `rioxarray`
